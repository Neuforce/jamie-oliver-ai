System Guidelines — Jamie Oliver

This product is an editorial + recipe experience, not a SaaS tool.

GENERAL
- Prioritize content over UI chrome
- Design for real people cooking at home
- Warm, human, approachable tone
- Desktop web by default
- Use Auto Layout, avoid absolute positioning

LAYOUT & HIERARCHY
- Clear vertical flow
- One primary action per screen
- Favor scrolling over complex navigation
- Each screen must clearly answer:
  What is this? What can I do next?

TYPOGRAPHY
- Base font size: 14px
- Strong hierarchy: title > section > body > metadata
- Editorial feel, not technical
- Avoid excessive font variation

IMAGERY
- Food imagery is the hero
- Natural, warm, realistic photography
- V1 uses images only (no video assumed)

COMPONENT RULES
- Buttons should feel helpful, not aggressive
- One primary button per screen or section
- Cards are the main browsing unit for recipes
- Entire recipe cards should be clickable

RECIPE EXPERIENCE
- Easy to scan
- Steps must be short and readable
- Avoid long paragraphs
- Important tips should stand out visually

WHAT NOT TO DO
- No dashboard-style UI
- No unnecessary interactions
- No visual clutter
- No assumption of expert cooking knowledge
