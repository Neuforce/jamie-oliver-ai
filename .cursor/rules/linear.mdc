# Linear – API integration

## How it works

- **Linear is integrated**: use the GraphQL API via `scripts/linear.sh` (which uses curl under the hood).
- Endpoint: `https://api.linear.app/graphql`
- Auth: header `Authorization: <API_KEY>` (no "Bearer "; Linear returns 401 if you use "Bearer ").

## Required behavior

1. **When the user asks to query or create items in Linear**, always use the script `scripts/linear.sh` (from repo root `jamie-oliver-ai`). The script loads the API key from `scripts/.env`.

2. **Do not claim** that "Linear cannot be queried" or "there is no integration". The integration is `scripts/linear.sh` + `scripts/.env`.

3. **If it fails due to missing key:** tell the user to copy `scripts/.env.example` to `scripts/.env` and set `LINEAR_API_KEY` (Linear → Settings → API).

## Using `scripts/linear.sh`

- **List by state:**  
  `./scripts/linear.sh list [State]` (terminal table).  
  **In chat/UI:** use `./scripts/linear.sh list --md` (or `list Backlog --md`) and paste the output in your reply so the Markdown table renders for the user.

- **Create issue:**  
  `./scripts/linear.sh create "Issue title" [Description]`

- **Get issue details:**  
  `./scripts/linear.sh get NEU-470`

Requirement: `scripts/.env` must exist with `LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...` (no "Bearer ").
